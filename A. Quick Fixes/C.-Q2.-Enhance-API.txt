Q2.Enhance your API to support extreme scalability, processing numerous simultaneous orders without data loss, and explain your strategies.
	Answer:
	
Strategy for extreme scalability---
	1.API Gateway and Load balancer
		we can use API gateway front of our servers and behind it load balancers for controlling traffic. It ill avoid servers from overloading during peak hours
	2.Microservice Architecture
		We can split the system into order,inventory and payment servie and they will work independently based on load and authentication
	3.Horizontal scaling of Database
		We can use to read replica to spread the reading load and use sharding for datasets and also can use noSQL for fast operations.
	4.Retry Mechanism
		fault tolarent design includes retry mechanism if queue fail.
	5.Monitoring and Auto scaling
		We could use monitors for order rate,API server CPU and Queue depth and use cloud autoscaling to spin up more servers during spikes
		
	The main point of extreme scalability comes down to "Scale out, not up" Rule that encourages to add more servers not bigger ones.also using async queues and smart cache and monitors.
