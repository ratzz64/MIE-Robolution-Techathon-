Even with the new smart ordering devices, ‘waiting for food’ can be a cause for customer’s frustration specially during peak hours when kitchens are overloaded. Customers have no idea how long their food will take, or where it is in the process. This uncertainty can make them impatient even if ordering became faster. “Live Order Progress Tracking” can be a solution for this hidden problem.  


## Live Order Progress Tracking : 
After placing an order, customers can view a real time visual timeline 
showing their meal’s journey from “Order Received” to “On the Way” on the device :  
### Order Received -> Being Prepared -> Cooking -> Almost Ready -> On the Way!! 
This process eliminates customers uncertainty about their meal along with enhancing their satisfaction 
and make the waiting experience more relaxed and engaging.
